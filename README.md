# AVLTree
Implementation of an AVLTree in Java

AVLTrees are binary search trees that guarantee a maximum height of O(log(n)) by performing rotations after adding or removing nodes.

These rotations keep the tree balanced by allowing the difference between the maximum heights of a node's children to be at most one (in absolute value).

The code is based on content and tasks from the edX course 'Data Structures & Algorithms III: AVL and 2-4 Trees, Divide and Conquer Algorithms'.
